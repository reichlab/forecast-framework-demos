### Installation
ForecastFramework is an open source R package hosted on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ForecastFramework/index.html) and [Github](https://github.com/HopkinsIDD/ForecastFramework). 

To install this package, either run the following commands in your [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) console:
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages('ForecastFramework')
```
Or:
```{r eval=FALSE}
require(devtools)
devtools::install_github('HopkinsIDD/ForecastFramework')
```


### The ForecastFramework Pipeline
Before creating your own ForecastFramework models, let's dive deeper into the forecasting process with ForecastFramework.

Below is a very basic example of the ForecastFramework pipeline: preprocessing, fitting, forecasting, and evaluating:

Each of the subsequent vignettes looks into a part of this process. However, the preprocesing stage will be included in the Defining Inputs Vignette.

### Vignette Overview:
* #### `The Data`
This section will examines the raw data used in the ForecastFramework models ahead.
* #### `Defining Inputs: Incidence Matrix`
(*Beginner Section*) This section will define what an Incidence Matrix is, show how to format your data to be used as an Incidence Matrix, and exemplify functions of Incidence Matrices.
* #### `Fitting and Forecasting: SARIMATD`
(*Beginner Section*)This section will focus on fitting data to a SARIMA model with ForecastFramework.
* ####`Evaluating Complex Models: SARIMATD, SARIMA, GAM`
(*Intermediate Section*) This section will demonstrate evaluation metrics and techniques by comparing two complex models in ForecastFramework.
* #### `Creating your own Model: SARIMATD`
(*Advanced Section*) This section will demonstrate how to create your own model with ForecastFramework. NOTE: This section requires object-oriented programming knowledge.

### Overview
This demonstration focuses on the simplest building block of any large forecasting experiment or study: how to make a forecast from one model at one time point for a single location. ForecastFramework makes it easy to generalize this process to multiple models, multiple time points and multiple locations. However, for starters, we will focus on the anatomy of a single forecast from a single model.

### About sarimaTD
Specifically, we will use a variation on standard [Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average models](https://otexts.org/fpp2/seasonal-arima.html). [sarimaTD](https://github.com/reichlab/sarimaTD) is an R package created by [Evan Ray](http://www.mtholyoke.edu/~eray/). sarimaTD stands for SARIMA with Transformations and Seasonal Differencing. sarimaTD is a model composed of a set of wrapper functions that simplify estimating and predicting traditional SARIMA models. These wrapper functions first transform the incidence data to approximate normality, then perform seasonal differencing (if specified), and input the new incidence data to the ``auto.arima`` function from the ``forecast`` package. These simple transformations have shown improved forecasting performance of SARIMA models for infectious disease incidence by increasing the numerical stability of the model.

### Fitting the ForecastFramework sarimaTD Model
#### 1. Import packages
First you must import all the required libraries. Note that ForecastFramework doesn't requre `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `cdcfluview` or `RCurl` but they will be used for sourcing the models on Github, getting the flu data, and producing the data processing and visualization.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ForecastFramework)
library(R6)
library(forecast)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(cdcfluview)

# Source R6 Files
library(RCurl)

# Function of Source Github Models
source_github <- function(u) {
  # read script lines from website and evaluate
  script <- getURL(u, ssl.verifypeer = FALSE)
  eval(parse(text = script),envir=.GlobalEnv)
}  
# Source R6 Files
source_github('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reichlab/forecast-framework-demos/master/models/ContestModel.R')
source_github('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reichlab/forecast-framework-demos/master/models/SARIMATD1Model.R')
```

Now it is time to fit your sarimaTD Model! ForecastFramework makes this easy. 

#### 2. Create new sarimaTDmodel Class
In this sarimaTD model, forecasts are created by simulating multiple time-series trajectories from models fit using the `forecast::auto.arima()` function. Therefore, we must define the number of simulations to generate, `nsim`. We also need to define the seasonal periodicity of our data, or the `period` parameter. For this forecast, we know the periodicity is 52, because the data is weekly. once we define these parameters, they can be passed into the `sarimaTDModel()` class generator to create a new `sarimaTDmodel` class.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
nsim <- 10 # Number of SARIMA simulations 
sarimaTDmodel <- SARIMATD1Model$new(period = 52, nsim = nsim)
```

#### 3. Import CDC Flu Data
To import the fluview data, use the `ilinet()` command. The data is then filtered to remove unneeded weeks and years. Then, the data is stored as an `IncidenceMatrix`. An `IncidenceMatrix` represents spatial time-series data in a matrix with one row per location and one column per time. To do this, another series of transformations are made. `IncidenceMatrix` is the preferred input for ForecastFramework Models.

The data will be put into a training, testing, and truth set. The training set will be used to fit the forecast model. The test set is the time period that the model will be forecasting from (this may include the training set). The truth set is the unknown validation data that the used to measure accuracy of the forecast model, this will not include the training data or the testing data. Below is a diagram to differentiate the different test splits:
<img src="images/data-split.jpg" class="large">

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

dat <- ilinet(region = "National")
dat <- dat %>% 
  filter( week != 53 &
          year > 2009 & 
          year < 2018 & 
          !(year == 2017 & week > 18))
dat <- dat %>%
  select('region','year','week','weighted_ili', 'week_start')

# Create a Preprocess Function
preprocess_inc <- function(dat){
  dat$time.in.year = dat$week
  dat$t = dat$year + dat$week/52
  inc = ObservationList$new(dat)
  inc$formArray('region','t',val='weighted_ili',
                dimData = list(NULL,list('week','year','time.in.year','t')),
                metaData = list(t.step = 1/52,max.year.time = 52))
  return(inc)
}

# Seperate into Training and Testing Data
training_data <- dat %>% 
  filter( ! ((year == 2016 ) | (year == 2017 ) ))
testing_data <- dat %>% 
  filter( ! ((year == 2016 & week >= 19) | (year == 2017 & week <= 18)) )
truth_data <- dat %>% 
  filter( ((year == 2016 & week >= 19) | (year == 2017 & week <= 18)) )

training_inc <- preprocess_inc(training_data)
testing_inc <- preprocess_inc(testing_data)
truth_inc <- preprocess_inc(truth_data)

```

Let's look at a sample from the new `IncidenceMatrix` to view the `IncidenceMatrix` Format:
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
print(training_inc$mat[,0:10])

```
Notice that the traditional dates have been transformed to fractions of a year.

#### 3. Fit the Model
Typically, different regions would be fit separately and have different forecasts. For the scope of this demo, we are only fitting and forecasting national data.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
sarimaTDmodel$fit(training_inc)
```

### Forecasting with the ForecastFramework sarimaTD Model
#### 4. Forecasting SARIMA
Before forecasting, you must specify how many periods ahead you would like to forecast. This is defined by the `steps` parameter. Then, you forecast with the `sarimaTDmodel$forecast()` method. This model will forecast one year into the future (26 biweeks).

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
steps <- 52 # forecast ahead 52 weeks
```

Then, use the built-in `$forecast()` function to create your forecasts. This creates a new R6 object with your forecasts and many other useful built-in functions. Be sure to check out the Evaluation section for usage of the Forecasting function.
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
forecast_X <- sarimaTDmodel$forecast(testing_inc,steps = steps)
```

### Plotting the Output
#### 5. Formatting the Forecast Output
To view the the median forecast of the simulations, execute the following command:
```{r, warning=FALSE}
forecast_X$median()$mat
```

Lets convert the forecast matrix to a dataframe in R for easy manipulation: 
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# converting predictions to a dataframe to use dplyr
preds_df <- data.frame(as.table(t(forecast_X$data$mat)))
```

To include the `date_sick` in the  `forecast_X$data$mat` output, map the forecast to its predicted dates is to create a new data frame with the data from the missing year. Then, we will combine the output in `forecast_X$data` with the correct biweek dates.
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# converting predictions to a dataframe to use dplyr
# import testing dataset which has 2013 data

# add prediction dates to original forecast
preds_df[["date_sick"]] <-as.Date(truth_data$week_start, format = "%d-%m-%Y")
```

Now, we can add the forecast to the `preds_df`. Notice the `$median()` and `$quantile()` functions accompanied with `$mat` will produce matricies with the prediction medians and quantiles, respectively. 
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
preds_df <- preds_df %>%
   mutate( 
      pred_total_cases = as.vector(forecast_X$median(na.rm=TRUE)$mat),
      pred_95_lb = as.vector(forecast_X$quantile(0.025,na.rm=TRUE)$mat),
      pred_95_ub = as.vector(forecast_X$quantile(0.975,na.rm=TRUE)$mat),
      pred_80_lb = as.vector(forecast_X$quantile(0.05,na.rm=TRUE)$mat),
      pred_80_ub = as.vector(forecast_X$quantile(0.95,na.rm=TRUE)$mat),
      pred_50_lb = as.vector(forecast_X$quantile(0.25,na.rm=TRUE)$mat),
      pred_50_ub = as.vector(forecast_X$quantile(0.75,na.rm=TRUE)$mat)
   )
print(head(preds_df,5)) # Print the first 5 rows
```

#### 6. Plot the Forecast Output
Finally, you are able to plot your sarimaTD Forecast! Lets use `ggplot2` to create a cool plot.

### Weighted ILI sarimaTD Forecast

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,echo=TRUE,fig.width=10, fig.height=4}
data_X_3years <- dat %>% filter(year > 2013)
ggplot(data=preds_df, aes(x=date_sick)) +
  geom_ribbon(
    mapping = aes(ymin = pred_95_lb, ymax = pred_95_ub),
    fill = "cornflowerblue",
    alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_ribbon(
    mapping = aes(ymin = pred_80_lb, ymax = pred_80_ub),
    fill = "cornflowerblue",
    alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_ribbon(
    mapping = aes(ymin = pred_50_lb, ymax = pred_50_ub),
    alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_line(
    mapping = aes(y = pred_total_cases),
    color = "royalblue",
    size = 2) +
  geom_line(aes(x = week_start, y = weighted_ili),
            size=0.7,
            data = data_X_3years) +
  xlab("") + ylab("Weighted ILI")
```
